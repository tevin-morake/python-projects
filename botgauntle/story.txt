To synthesize a document using this method, you must have an Amazon S3 bucket that is writable to which the audio file can be saved. You can be notified when the synthesized audio is ready by providing an optional SNS Topic identifier. When the synthesis task is complete, Amazon Polly will publish a message on that topic. This message may also contain useful error information in cases where the synthesis task didn't succeed. To do this, make sure that the user creating the synthesis task can also publish to the SNS Topic. See the Amazon SNS documentation for more information on how to create and subscribe to an SNS Topic.
